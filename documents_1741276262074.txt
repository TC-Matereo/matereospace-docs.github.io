With sensors constantly gathering data in real time, we help turn those numbers into practical insights that make buildings and waterways safer, and weather easier to manage. This collection of case studies shows how we've tackled different challenges across three areas: Buildings & Bridges  – Keeping an eye on how weather, temperature shifts, and wear and tear affect structures over time. Rivers & Oceans  – Tracking water quality for Oceanographic research. Weather  – Using sensor data to better predict storms, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events."
